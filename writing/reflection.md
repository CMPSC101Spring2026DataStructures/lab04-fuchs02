Please answer the following questions after you have completed the programming lab. Write your answers in complete sentences and provide thoughtful responses.

## Comprehension Questions

1. What is the purpose of breaking a program into functions? How did this help you in completing the lab?

Your Response:

It alowes for a cleaner and more reusable code. In compleating this lab it allowed for a a clean main function that consisted of only around 15 line compared to the others hundred somthing lines which held the whole game. 


2. Describe how you validated user input in your version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Why is input validation important?

Your Response:

Using if and elif statments it ensure the choice is in the listed choices or dictioary and if so it allows the choice pass. If not it prints an error message and the user losses the round. 

3. How did you use comments and docstrings in your code? Give an example of a helpful comment or docstring you wrote.

Your Response:

Through use of the thurpgh to-do messages I created code comments and each of the fucntions had pre sdetermined docstrings making the whole prosses very easy to implement. 

4. Explain how the computer's move is generated in your program. What Python features did you use to accomplish this?

Your Response:

Using the imported random command it allows the computer to have a randomly generated choice from withing the choicies list. I used the import command to make this work using import random. 

5. What was the most challenging part of refactoring the spaghetti code into a more structured program? How did you overcome this challenge?

Your Response:

The most challenging part was repuposing the already written if statment into two seperate functions that worked seperate from each other. 

## Ethical Reflection Questions

1. Why is it important to write code that is easy for others to read and maintain? How does this relate to your responsibilities as a programmer?

Your Response:

Its important to make code readable as it allows other to learn off of and create more off your own code. As for your responsibilities as a programmer readable code realates as it easies the integration between user and machine. 

2. Consider the use of open source code (like the spaghetti code provided). What are some ethical considerations when using, modifying, or sharing code written by others?
